A basic webpage is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML lays out the content, like text, images, and buttons, while CSS makes everything look nice with colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript brings the page to life by adding things like animations, pop-ups, and form validation. Together, they create a smooth and engaging experience for users.
